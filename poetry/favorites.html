  <h2>Even If</h2>
  <p>
    And even if her whole body looks like a watercolor painting, that doesn’t mean<br>
    you can dip your hands into the palettes of her hips and brush between her legs.<br>
    And even if her smile seems as inviting as a chandelier, don’t try<br>
    hanging yourself from the ceiling of her thighs just to get a glimpse inside.<br>
    And even if her dress is already halfway off, do the math.<br>
    The two letters that make up “No” will never equal the three letters of a “Yes.”<br>
    And even if you’re hungry like a wolf, lust isn’t love,<br>
    So keep your paws and teeth to yourself.<br>
    And even if there’s drinking involved, remember she isn’t drunk on you<br>
    so don’t try to put her further under the influence, especially<br>
    when the influence is you.<br>
    And even if you want to stick your tongue down her throat like a metal pole in winter,<br>
    that doesn’t mean you can’t try getting yourself unpeeled first.<br>
    Thaw your greediness before letting yourself get frozen in the wrong path.<br>
    And even if she doesn’t look like your narrow-minded image of a woman,<br>
    then maybe the magnifying glass you’re using is cracked and dirty<br>
    and raping her certainly won’t turn her into the person you want her to be.<br>
    And even if she’s passed out and no one else is around,<br>
    try “passing” on the opportunity to ruin her life instead.<br>
    And even if you think saying a prayer before breaking down<br>
    the church of her body is going to save you, it won’t.<br>
    Because you don’t deserve her forgiveness.<br>
    And even if you’re going to say later that she was asking for it,<br>
    she wasn’t.<br>
    You were just too self-absorbed to pay attention to her answer.<br>

<h2>breathing in morse code</h2>

<p>
  Today I memorize your heartbeat line by line.<br>

  You once got a tattoo of the spikes of breath that show up<br>

  on a breathing machine in the hospital, on your forearm<br>

  above the tiny red birthmark that looked like the blood<br>

  of a grapefruit shot with a handgun. I once read<br>

  about an elderly man who used to call up complete strangers<br>

  every day before his death, and talked about things<br>

  like their favorite type of pizza, their never-ending loneliness,<br>

  or the rise and fall of the stock market. He did this <br>

  for four years straight, and informed the local newspaper<br>

  that the best calls he ever made<br>

  were the ones in which no one spoke.<br>

  Just breath on the other end.<br>

  And tonight I remember how I used to measure<br>

  all the space I spent without you in the distance<br>

  between our fingertips, until one day you left me<br>

  for some other woman, and I went to bed<br>

  remembering that you were 450 finger-lengths away.<br>

  I didn’t know yet that you would come back to me<br>

  again, and leave me three more times<br>

  before the year was over, and all I’d be left with<br>

  was the voicemails I made<br>

  of you breathing down my phone line.<br>
</p>
